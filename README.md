# STRIDE-CH 1.0

Magnetic-Field Constrained Ensemble Image Segmentation of Coronal Holes

## Abstract

Coronal Holes (CHs) are large-scale, low-density regions in the solar atmosphere which may expel high-speed solar wind streams that incite hazardous, geomagnetic storms. Coronal and solar wind models can predict these high-speed streams and the performance of the coronal model can be validated against segmented CH boundaries. We present a novel method named Sub-Transition Region Identification of Ensemble Coronal Holes (STRIDE-CH) to address prominent challenges in segmenting CHs with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imagery. Ground-based, chromospheric He I 10830 Ã… line imagery and underlying Fe I photospheric magnetograms are revisited to disambiguate CHs from filaments and quiet Sun, overcome obscuration by coronal loops, and complement established methods in the community which use space-borne, coronal EUV observations. Classical computer vision techniques are applied to constrain the radiative and magnetic properties of detected CHs, produce an ensemble of boundaries, and compile these boundaries in a confidence map that quantifies the likelihood of CH presence throughout the solar disk. This method is science-enabling towards future studies of CH formation and variability from a mid-atmospheric perspective.

## Code Structure

1. `STRIDE-CH.ipynb`: Notebook for producing STRIDE-CH data products.
2. `settings.py`: Script for declaration of data locations in file system.
3. `prepare_data.py`: Library of functions to prepare observations for CH detection.
4. `detect.py`: Library of functions to detect CHs.
5. `plot_detection.py`: Library of functions to plot observations and data products.
6. `Exploration.ipynb`: Notebook for exploratory development of STRIDE-CH. This notebook is not polished, but made visible for the sake of completeness.

## Dependencies

### Conda Environment (Optional)

An environment can help to better manage Python packages and dependencies. An installation of anaconda or miniconda will be needed. Once installed run the following commands:
```
conda create --name stride-ch python=3.11.0
conda activate stride-ch
```

### Python Dependency Installation

```
cd STRIDE-CH
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For Development

```
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```
