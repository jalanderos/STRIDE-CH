This format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased v1.1] - TBD

### Added

- Confidence derivation from unipolarity and smoothness features described in 3.2. Segmentation and Appendix A.2, along with a proximity to disk center feature, as aggregated by a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model
- Fusion of confidence maps with those produced by the Active Contours Without Edges (ACWE) algorithm, whose code is available at https://github.com/DuckDuckPig/CH-ACWE
